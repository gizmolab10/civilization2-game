## Maps

A map is divided into clickable shapes. Clicking on one of these shapes can take the player into a booth or into a zoomed in portion of the map, i.e., another map. These shapes can appear as a suggestive image which represents where the user will go. Maps will be used in several contexts: the carnival, neighborhoods, regions and the portal device.

## Locations and rooms

A location consists in one or more views of an end destination. For example, a booth, a room in a home, a restaurant, a picnic table, a riverside scene, forum, classroom or courtroom.

## Contributions

Several repositories will be needed for our game: needs, opinions and knowledge. Adding to each of them will be done through a typical looking input form. Since all players will want to be able to understand each entry, some amount of help editing the text in these input forms will be needed and provided by players who like this sort of task. The exact details of how this is done are not yet clear.

## Searches

Searching will obviously be done through use of search keys and indexing. Multiple related search results will need to be displayed in some kind of hierarchy the look of which needs to be worked out.

## Hierarchies

How we will visually present hierarchies will depend on the items being presented (members of a guild, guilds, needs, opinions and knowledge). A simple treelike structure will suffice for items that are neither too numerous nor too complex. For other items, we will need to provide a narrow selection of items and a means of browsing to nearby selections.

## Toolkits

This we have only vague sense of. Objects can be arranged in a catalog, wherein similar tools are gathered into groups, the names of which might appear in a list. Tools that represent coding elements are beyond the current technologies that we know about and so will need to be invented, as will the means of displaying and choosing coding elements for using to build and enhance the game.
