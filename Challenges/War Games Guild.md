# War Games Guild

## We're an aggressive species

Aggression is important.  It helps us meet our needs as individuals and as a species. We use it to overcome obstacles, gather up resources, marshal courage, endure.

Because we get emotional satisfaction from it, we may have occasions when we love engaging others in violence, mayhem and destruction. Some players will seek opportunities for this within our game. We expect to encourage them to play in a war games area.

Members of the war games guild are trained. They acquire skill in the graceful and subtle art of helping warriors identify the needs behind their love of being warlike. Help them become better at meeting those needs. Invite them to perhaps join the guild.

## How is this training done?

That's another open question, the answer to which must come from experts, such as those who teach non-violent communication.
