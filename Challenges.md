# Big Technical Challenges

## Pushing the limits

Some of the game components that I feel are required are beyond my and perhaps industry capabilities:

-   [opinions and consensus](https://www.game.civilization2.org/opinions)  
-   [game building tools](https://www.game.civilization2.org/tools) 
-   [war games](https://www.game.civilization2.org/war)  

Developing them will require contributions of cutting edge thinking, skills and tools, supported by research (probably at university level). Involving university attention and effort is a dream wish for us.

I need to investigate further and would love to [hear from anyone](http://www.civilization2.org/voice) who is (or who knows someone who is) doing research into any of the above.
