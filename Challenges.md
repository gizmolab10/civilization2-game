# Big Technical Challenges

## Pushing the limits

Some of the game components that I feel are required are beyond my and perhaps industry capabilities:

- [[Opinions Guild]]  
- [[Builders Guild]]  
- [[War Games Guild]]  

Developing them will require contributions of cutting edge thinking, skills and tools, supported by research (probably at university level). Involving university attention and effort is a dream wish for us.

I need to investigate further and would love to [hear from anyone](mailto:sand@gizmolab.com) who is (or who knows someone who is) doing research into any of the above.
