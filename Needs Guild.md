# How should we build a needs guild?

![[Image by DJ Johnson.jpg.webp]]  

Players must be able to request something they need, track its delivery, and apply regard points. Describing a need can introduce idiosyncratic language, making them hard to recognize. Other players must be able to search existing requests and indicate those they can fulfill.

## A defect tracking tool

One open source option is to use a bug or defect tracking system and cover it over with a game face. A need is like a defect in several ways. A description of a need that is brief and easy to recognize and understand. Dependencies on other needs help players tackle needs bit by bit. Categories of needs can help with searching and listing. Likely we will want to add other subtleties, so our tracking system must be extensible.

## What does our needs list look like now?

Until the needs tool exist, we can manually maintain the list here, but not in any particularly useful order:

-   database
    -   hosting
    -   create data
-   defect tracking source code
    -   game face
    -   custom fields and flows
    -   monitor/negotiate (second-person) editing
-   [guilds guild](https://www.game.civilization2.org/guilds-guild)  
    -   create new guild​
    -   split a guild
    -   roles (master, apprentice, spokesperson)
