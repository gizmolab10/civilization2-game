## The mind of the game

![[Jellyfish in Aquarium.webp]]


I would love to see theÂ thoughts about 2.0 collected and organized and made available in a pleasant UI. A help system comes to mind, amped up with cool features the game guild adds along the way.

Each of these topics deserves some development:

- knowledge
- information
- education
- research
- technology
- open questions
- confusion
- wicked problems
- collaboration
- collective intelligence
